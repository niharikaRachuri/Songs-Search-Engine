My head hits the ground I feel like I'm no one I'm lost in the crowd It makes no sense at all So divided we fall I'm breaking my silence But you don't hear me call And you don't see me fall  Feels like I'm falling It's time but your stalling You said all you need is a little time and some space These words that you've spoken Have left me so broken Seems at this moment that I've fallen from grace  And everyday just feels the same I try so hard to walk away from everything I am Just closing in on me I just can't face the pain I sit around and wonder why? So many dreams can fade and die Well nothing is forever everything is never And I can't say goodbye  Feels like I'm falling It's time but your stalling You said all you need is a little time and some space These words that you've spoken Have left me so broken Seems at this moment that I've fallen from grace \"]],\n",
